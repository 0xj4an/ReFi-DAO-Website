# ReFi DAO 3.0 Vision & Strategic Models

**Last Updated:** November 2025  
**Status:** For Network Validation  
**Purpose:** Present multiple alternative strategic models for ReFi DAO 3.0 to enable network-wide validation and selection

---

## Overview

This document presents **five alternative strategic models** for ReFi DAO 3.0, each representing a different approach to operational scaling, financial sustainability, network growth, and governance evolution. These models are presented for network validation rather than as a single prescriptive approach.

**Key Principle:** The network will validate and select the primary model (or hybrid approach) through governance processes including forum discussion, Gardens signaling, and contributor feedback.

## 1. Vision Statement (Common Foundation)

### Mission
**Platform-Integrated Network Society**

ReFi DAO 3.0 represents the transition from infrastructure building to operational scaling—leveraging the infrastructure we've built to create measurable regenerative impact at scale.

### Transition Context

**From ReFi DAO 2.0 (Infrastructure Building):**
- Established governance frameworks
- Deployed on-chain roles and funding mechanisms
- Created community pathways and documentation

**To ReFi DAO 3.0 (Operational Scaling):**
- Leverage infrastructure for measurable impact
- Activate diversified revenue streams
- Scale local nodes and Network Initiatives
- Integrate with emerging platforms
- Mature governance processes

### Key Shifts

1. **Financial Model:** From grant-dependent → diversified revenue (service fees, partnerships, sponsorships, token integration)
2. **Network Initiatives:** From scoping → launched and operational (Research & Media, Local Node Support)
3. **Local Nodes:** From pilot stage → scaled support with growth targets
4. **Platform Integration:** From external partnerships → integrated with Regenerative.fi ecosystem
5. **Governance:** From infrastructure setup → mature processes with contribution-weighted participation

### Success Metrics (Common Across Models)
