# ReFi DAO 3.0 Planning & Documentation

**Status:** In Progress  
**Last Updated:** November 2025  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive planning and documentation for ReFi DAO's transition from 2.0 to 3.0

## Overview

This directory contains all planning and documentation for ReFi DAO 3.0, the next iteration of ReFi DAO following the completion of ReFi DAO 2.0 infrastructure building phase.

**Key Principle:** Each phase is consolidated into a single comprehensive document. Strategic models are presented as alternatives for network validation rather than a single prescriptive approach.

## Document Structure

2. **[Closure Checklist](closure-checklist.md)** - Complete checklist of tasks needed to close ReFi DAO 2.0, including infrastructure completion, Network Initiatives launch, platform integration, documentation, and financial sustainability

3. **[Vision & Strategic Models](vision-strategic-models.md)** - Multiple alternative strategic models (5 options) for ReFi DAO 3.0, presented for network validation with comparison matrix and recommendation framework

4. **[Documentation Structure](documentation-structure.md)** - Simplified directory structure and integration points with existing documentation

5. **[Implementation Plan](implementation-plan.md)** - Step-by-step implementation roadmap with timeline, milestones, and network validation process
