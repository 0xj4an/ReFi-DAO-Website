WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Yes let's do, it uh thanks, a lot everyone for joining and for giving the, quick introductions.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Um i'm, gonna now. Oh amazing thank you? Mountain team that's, quite important um i'm gonna start sharing, my screen here to go through uh some materials that, we got uh we got, to prepare.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Hmm okay so can you already see my screen nicely let's see here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Okay amazing thank you. Uh so yes, again as i mentioned, thanks a lot for uh, joining this.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
End of year uh support, workshop to local notes.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Um basically the, intention was to um compile basically all the, resources and kind of uh, yeah supports that we provide uh to local nodes.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And be having a final a last touch point, uh this year to, basically see how, uh yeah how you all are in the development, of your local notes if you're already, a local note, lead.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Um but basically. To bring together people in all stages of starting a local note.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Uh so either whether, um if it is a more developed node or if it is uh you just have the idea of starting a local knowledge in our region.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Um yeah basically the, intention, here with the workshop is, to bring everyone together and have some knowledge experience sharing.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Uh and for us to, share, the the resources that we have to to support in the process.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Uh. Okay so that's, a quick uh the quick agenda that we're gonna uh follow today.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Uh we already did get to have the round of introductions.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So let's keep that? Um. So yes.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
As i mentioned uh we're, compiling here all the, resources that we have available for new local notes.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Um and i'm, gonna be going through some of these, um and.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Yes so the main. Resource that we have is the onboarding guide um i'll be, sharing the link.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
To it uh on the, tab here on zoom.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Which i left a second.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Okay just did so if you'd like you? Can also follow uh there basically the content.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Uh, so. Cool i'm, gonna be going through the presentation again as i mentioned you, can go through the the page.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Um so the onboarding process that we have for local notes um the first.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Step uh so the, steps are. To join the communication gardens, uh gardens is the platform that? We use for uh we've been using for most of the governance in uh riffel's network.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Um it uses conviction voting so that uh the community can have a weight on uh.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Yeah what proposals to pass and, so on. Uh by joining the uh refi dial garden um.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:19.000
You become? Uh an a referral network member um and from there you? Can basically start your journey to uh yeah develop your node or just be part of the network.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Um so there are a few steps in the process as i mentioned the first one is to uh join the gardens then there is a little, interest form.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
For forming a new local note.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The next two to, three years getting to about a trillion dollars off.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I'm, also, gonna be i still. Hello society welcome oh nice thank you? For muting yourself.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Um so then if you're interested in uh starting a local note we have this local note, formation interest form.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Um i'm, gonna be sharing here on the. Chat soonish as, well um.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So yeah if you're interested in starting a note uh a new local note please uh fill up this form and then we'll be following up.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Uh with you? And supporting you? In the process.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Um and then here bringing a bit of, what happens, after you uh yeah the initial idea of the local note is approved.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Um we'll give some follow up giving you? All the um.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Out the directions and instructions to uh continue. With the formation of the local node.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Um and now i'll go through the, specific uh resources that we, have available for new local notes.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Hmm so here are a few resources that we've been uh preparing uh the, last couple of.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Here's basically, um some of them can, be, quite useful and they're all available for free for new local notes for.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Oh local notes uh so yeah. It can be useful.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000
If you'd like to use some of them. Uh and now let me actually get intro um each one of them.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Uh so one, of the most relevant ones is definitely the local note graphic assets figma design.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Board uh so it is, from, um a couple of years ago basically from, uh john's uh.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Leadership like, age so thanks a lot for uh preparing and uh yeah leaving this resource, uh for.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Lock on ots now um. And basically on the on this figma board uh, there's, a bunch, of templates of different? Kinds of graphics so um.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
The, logo for your local note, uh graphic.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Um all sort of uh. Yeah graphics like, banner images uh, posts.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Um things for events as well. Uh there's quite a few stuff there so uh one of the initial steps of uh starting your local knowledge is basically to go there and start uh developing your own nodes.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Uh. Visual identity. Uh, so yeah basically see how.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Uh to fit three five, dollars branding into the, specific context of the local note let me see if i can actually.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Go through the board really quick, would actually be nice to um.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Sure a couple, of examples. Uh, so i think you can see here right screen.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Uh, let me share, my screen actually real quick um.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Yes we see it.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Sure yes okay nice.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Uh because we actually, have some even newer resources.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
That's super cool.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Um that i can share.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Um if you? Just give me one. Deck here we go shaft.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
That's.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Um.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So that's just loading and. Then we have look so uh this, was actually developed by adam.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Um one of our new designers. And has created.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:11.000
These templates, with detailed instructions. Uh for how, to create, um the aligned uh branding and, a whole bunch of assets so here we have event posters, uh with different? Quotes on it um aligned with different? Uh pieces and i think we would love to build like a library of, like.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:21.000
The most aligned interesting posters people can fork them create their own, versions um and then print them out in lots, of banners as company, to events so i think we can continue to grow that.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Um we have here if it will load.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Um.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Oh here oh yeah his his um. Some a brochure a brochure template so if you want to customize a local node brochure put your links on there put your, key things around around the local node as well as the global network.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And that's quite a nice additional asset uh we. Have the making the urn banner customizing it with your place behind um the thing to create this really clean.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Um, quite, uh, nice-looking, uh, banner for your place, um, and… and then the logo one is not seeming to load, but that's also there.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Um, and what was this one? Yeah, that, uh, so yeah, that's some of the latest, uh, ones, in addition to the ones that Louise was sharing, uh, there as well. So, um…

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Just sharing that as an asset, once you've gone through the process, this is, uh, you know, a key benefit of being part of the network.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Back to you, Louise.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Amazing, thanks a lot for showing this one, Monty.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
So, all of these resources are all linked in the local knowledge onboarding Guide.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So, uh, yeah, please go through that, and you'll be able to see all of the

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Yeah, resources and assets that we have.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Uh, let me show my screen again…

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Monty, is that… it happens to be in our refi notion page. I think that's… I think that's what we…

00:08:49.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Yes. Yes, uh, so, actually, if you… we're gonna come out with a full updated guide and, kind of, hub with all of these assets and a process for it, so we'll share that on the Telegram groups for just kind of finalizing some of the texts and…

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And the processes for it. Uh, but yes, these assets will all be available to all validated local nodes.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Uh, so yeah, I'll share that… share that on the Telegram group soon.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Nice.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I'm having now some minor issues sharing my screen, uh, but let me try…

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
That's another way…

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Okay. Nice.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Okay, cool, amazing. So, again, thanks, Moji, for going through the, uh, yeah, new, um, graphic assets board as well.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:53.000
So, again, everything linked on the onboarding guide on Notion, the one that I shared on the chat, and we'll be sharing again more throughout

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Um, then going on to the next resource, uh, we also have the local node canvas.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Uh, so that's an optional one, so it's, uh, not…

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
as mandatory, let's say, as developing your node's own, uh, graphic, uh, assets.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:21.000
But this is really, really good to give some, um, yeah, the development on the node, and to basically, uh, yeah, develop what are the assumptions.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Actually, like, the construct what are the assumptions, and um… yeah.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
define what are the key aspects of the nodes, what strategy is going to follow.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Um, and so on. Um… I don't know, it's quite a, uh…

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
fairly common, uh, model.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
As a business canvas, but it's already focusing here in the context of local nodes.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Uh, so it can be quite useful, uh, to, yeah, develop this strategy for, for a local node.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Uh, let me go on to the next one.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Then we also have the local node toolkit.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Uh, the local node toolkit is a compilation of resources that have been prepared throughout this last years.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Uh, by local nodes on how to organize events, how to also strategize and develop the vision for your local node.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Um, it also includes some of the basics of what actually is a local node, how to engage the community, and so on.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Um, and the idea is that, uh, the toolkit here, uh, is something that we are constantly growing.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Uh, so if you are a local noder and have any experience, any knowledge that you, uh, think would be nice to share with other local notes,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:45.000
would be great to get, um, yeah, uh, additional inclusions here.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Uh, so, yeah, here are the toolkit.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Um, yeah, as I mentioned, more toolkits are being prepared, and uh, yeah, if any local node is, uh,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
interested in sharing, that'd be appreciated. We are also, um…

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
We have also some plans for the local refi toolkit.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
connecting with, uh, an initiative that we started with, uh, region coordination.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Um, but then we'll be… yeah.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.000
It's still quite early in the development of the local refi toket, so that would be something a little bit more later on.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Um, additionally, I also wanted to share here, uh, something, uh, from, uh, the side of Refa Barcelona. So, something that, um, I personally have been preparing.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
is this, uh, Quartz website.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
toolkit, that is basically a template, uh, that is

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
hopefully really easy to fork, and then self-host your own website for free.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Um, so it's really good for, um…

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
For a local note to put up.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:59.000
like a simple website or a one-pager, um, to, yeah, have it there, to be able to share around and basically state what are the, uh, what the local note is about.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Um, and so for that, we are providing the framework, and, uh, yeah, all the, um,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Here it comes!

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.000
system to easily fork it and create your own local node website and knowledge base.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Um, right now we're still… we're quite, uh, in… it's still quite in… quite in, uh, in an early stage.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Uh, so we just, um, we just adopted JT Refer Barcelona. We've also been adopting it in the, uh, local funding program that we've been running with, uh, with Barcelona that is the Juneta and Catalonia, that we talking a bit more about as well.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Um, and also are testing in Refidel, um,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Uh, for the network, um…

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And also for Revamaged Iranian and Refi Provence with Alejandra.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Yeah. This one is particularly cool. I mean, right now, for RefaDow, we've been spending hundreds of… hundreds of dollars a month on various software platforms, like Airtable, uh, website builders,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:06.000
and things like that. And what Louise has essentially done here is created a fully open source, uh, free version that just runs on GitHub, and all you pay for is a domain.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:18.000
like, $10 a year, and you can have… and you could just fork this website, edit the content, and suddenly you've got a website for your node that's open source and interconnected with a network, the global website, and other nodes across the globe all

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Uh, in the back end. And then we can do some pretty fancy stuff with AI and knowledge graphs and connect them all up. So, this is, I think, a really exciting

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
you've got a infrastructure that just becomes

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:45.000
replicable and free for the entire network. Um, and so anyone can spin up a homepage for their website and showcase what they're doing. So I'm excited to share that. I also would love to connect in. I know some nodes have already built websites, and I know, you know, the Columbia crew have their

00:14:45.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Have a great site. So, you know, there's, uh, maybe we can add in other templates and, uh, versions and forks into a kind of library of, uh, of assets for people to leverage. So, awesome work, Louise, pulling this together, and excited to add this into the

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Nice, thank you. Uh, yeah, thanks for, um, talking a bit more about it.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Um, and I'm quite happy that, uh, we got together a nice working version already, and we're already starting to implement.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Uh, so, also, if you'd be interested, feel free to reach me out. Here's my Telegram, or just in any, uh,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
like Telegon Group. Um, but yeah, that…

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Then, moving on to the next ones, um, this is just a quick one before this, um,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So, after you develop your local node, uh, uh, so yeah, develop, like, some initial, uh, aspects of your local node,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Um, then we… yeah, we have this, uh, funding pool on gardens, uh, that is to fund the, uh, initial activities of a local node.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Uh, so be it, uh, an event, a workshop, um, a mapping exercise, um,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:00.000
We… yeah, you can basically put up a proposal for up to 500 USD Glow, uh, to fund this initial activity.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Um, and… yeah, and then basically just…

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Then, before that, we ask for an additional, uh…

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:20.000
form, um, and that basically should be following up with, uh, what progress had been achieved, uh, yeah, have been achieved already, uh, by the nodes. So, if you go to…

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
develop, like, go through.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
into the toolkit.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Uh, the, uh, necessary and optional steps for developing a local node.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And you're already ready to actually kickstart the activities of the node to the public, basically.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Yeah, so you'll have your Telegram channel set up, your community in there, your social media channels, your KarmaGap page,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And your graphic assets built, um, and then put it all into that form, and then we have, uh, in a database, and then we can showcase that on our website, the channels, and

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And your, kind of, node is fully launched, and then there's an initial, kind of, $500 to kickstart your first activation.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Um, and get started. Uh, so I think, Louise, we've had maybe 3 or 4 nodes come in in the last, uh, 3-4 months, uh, through this.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
process, and we've just kind of refined it a bit, and I think what we'll do from here is invite

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
those new nodes and some of the existing ones to just…

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:31.000
come through this process as well, and then we just have this wonderful resource of all of the active, uh, nodes and the kind of current state of them. So expect a kind of process coming up for that.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Yes, exactly. Thanks, Monty. And yeah, we actually have two, um, two notes here that got, uh, funded already through the Kickstarter pool.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:47.000
So, uh, Rifa Nogo on the first, um, event there, um, I'd be quite keen to hear how it was at some point.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Um, and also from Refin Paka, in the process of being renamed to Refi Provence, so…

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Uh, yeah, happy to already be, uh, finding a new local notester, and, uh, yeah, we'll be sharing more, so that, uh, also other local notes and so on.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
can participate as well.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Then, going through…

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Uh, so that's basically it for, uh, the resources that we currently have available for, uh, local nodes.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:24.000
As we mentioned, we will be developing more and ideas to create a library of resources, a library of toolkits of how to implement it all, and so on.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Uh, so if you'd have an idea, uh, any suggestion,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Yeah, like, if you're a local node leader, and you did, like, a nice experiment, like, for instance, uh, the, uh, Riva Colombia nodes are RIFA Medellin,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Like, with the UBI experiment, and you'd like to share, like, a guidebook for how, like, a local node can adopt, like, a UBI mechanism,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:45.000
soon, which we'll share on the Telegram group with everyone.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Um, yeah, that would be something, uh, nice to be, uh, collecting, and then growing the library over time.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Um, and yeah, that's basically what we have for now, uh, for resources to be

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Um, yeah, to be prepared.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Yeah.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Um, can you hear any questions? We have now a little open space for quest… uh, yeah, basically this space for, uh, questions, and then also we're gonna have an open space talking about

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Uh, yeah, doing some… some experience and knowledge sharing between local nodes.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Yeah, awesome, thanks so that… so much, Louise, for…

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:36.000
for presenting all that, and just picking up on that last point, I think it's super interesting. Um, it mentioned, uh, the Refer Colombia has developed, like, a, um, a lending, a community lending platform where trusted members of the community can apply to get a loan, and they've built an on-chain app that facilitates that whole process.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000
And in the spirit… in the same spirit of the open source website toolkit that Louise has built, you know, we'd like to

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:55.000
document that, and have that as something that any other node could say, hey, that sheet would be a great fit for my community, and here are the ways I can easily replicate that in my area. So if you're doing something cool,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.000
in your local place, and, um, in the spirit of reciprocity, you want to support the global network, um, then

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:15.000
you know, we'd love to work with you, um, to develop that into a, uh, an open source toolkit that others can adopt, um, and we have some funding available to support the creation of those toolkits and playbooks as well.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Um, so… yeah, continue to grow, grow the resource library, uh, and, and support the network.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:32.000
That's what we've been cooking, um, this year a bit, and, uh, some much more, uh, many more exciting updates as well coming as well, so we'll be sharing a kind of, um,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:43.000
end of year reflection report and 2026 vision, um, stuff on the forum, and I know John's going to present some of the ideas of some research we're doing, uh, to support that.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Um, so, yeah, we'd love to invite any questions, thoughts, comments, um…

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:56.000
I see Warria has already got her hand up, so let's, uh, start there.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Thank you! Hi, everybody. Well, we are very happy.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:08.000
a Drifa Colombia, we adopted highly successful managing subside program.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:25.000
And now, we are applying this to more arrests for the country, from the coast of Colombia to the Amazon. So, where we are so very happy from this, and I just want to share this, and thank you very much.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
A for the opportunity.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Could you explain a little bit to the folks what the subsidy program is, um, and how that works?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Okay, yeah. Yeah, it's a program for people, um… They are very… Need some help, I don't know how to say that. Yeah, from people for low recourse resources. So, it's a little help. We do this from the water tooth to Cup.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:07.000
in the C-COP, is the payment, is the stablecoin of Colombia. So that's what we create, like, the adoption also. And this subsidies, they receive this, uh.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Yeah, how do you say that? A final of 6 days?

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:22.000
the 7 days, all 7 days, they can reclaim the subsidies.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Cool. So my…

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:40.000
So this is how it works. Yeah, it helps a lot of people. There are, uh… People can buy something, or it's just a help from these kind of people, and we are happy because this program is growing, just not from the people of Medellin and Antukas.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Uh, just for old Colombia, because we have a lot of, uh… people that we need this, eh.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:54.000
subsid, yeah.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Got it.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Yeah.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Awesome, amazing. Just to repeat back what I heard in my understanding on it, and you can tell me if it's correct, um, it's essentially almost like a UBI-type platform, where, um, started by Rifa Medellin, where anyone who's kind of disadvantaged or whatever can go onto the… this platform.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:28.000
And every 7 days, they can claim a small amount of Colombian pesos, uh, that are on-chain, so Selo has an on-chain Colombian peso, um, and, um, there's a pool then, and maybe that pool generates some yield, and so it creates an ongoing supply, and then anyone from the country, now expanded from Refo Medellin to the whole of Colombia,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000
can come and claim a small amount, which generates some onboarding to the Web3 systems, and is providing real support for people

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Uh, in the community, and kind of bringing them into the ReFight Columbia ecosystem. Um, which I think is a pretty, pretty cool mechanism, and it would be awesome to see if other nodes wanted to, um, to implement in that, in their places.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Um, was that a fair representation, Warrior? And thank you.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Yeah, yeah, perfect. That's it. You feel very well.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Amazing.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
We're very happy. Thank you very much.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Awesome, and feel free to drop a link in the chat, I see Vincent's asking for it.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Uh, cool, friends! Hello.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
bands are there?

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Friends, you're muted if you're… if you're trying to speak, but I see you've got your hand raised if you wanted to…

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:28.000
unmute and say hello.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Uh, maybe we'll go to one quickly while Franz figures out his…

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Uh, mute button.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Hey, how are you? You can hear me? Okay, so, yeah, I just want to add something, uh… So, wider, wider side.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Um, is… is that… The subsistence is not like a pool where, like.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Oh.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000
We are making, like, revenue? No, but by now, by the moment, it's not, it's not that way.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:12.000
By now, it's just like the subsidy contract, you can… you can go and.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:19.000
donate something. I'm gonna just leave the link here, is subsidio.oraficcolombia.org.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:28.000
It's just like… we just migrated the domain from Medellin to Colombia, and we are just revamping the UI and stuff like that.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:38.000
And you can go there, and you are gonna… if you can open the link, maybe, Monty, in the screen, you can see there, like.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:47.000
There is an option to claim the subsidy when you connect the wallet, and it's gonna say, like, you are not a beneficiary, but if you are a beneficiary, you can claim the subsidy.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
And also, you will see, like, the option to donate.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:06.000
So you can just donate any amount of CCOB. We just have the… The option to donate in C-Corp, but we are going to integrate their, like, you need to put the amount of C corp and just click on donate.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:14.000
If you have C-Pub, you are going to be able to donate. If not, you're only going to be able to donate. But we are going to, like.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Improve this. So, people will be able to donate in any token, and the contract is gonna.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000
swap the tokens into C-Corp. So, when people claim the funds, they always get C-COP.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
And this is… this is, like, the simple UI. If somebody.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.000
If somebody has, like, a wallet, and they want to claim the subsidy by desktop UI.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Okay, that was the old form. That form also needs to be, like, revamped and updated.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
But the idea here is, like, people don't need to interact with this.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.000
This is, like, if just somebody wants to do through the web app.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:12.000
But people, when they download the Tuco Wallet, that is the wallet that… Everyone in Colombia is… We are trying to… everyone in Colombia use that wallet.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:29.000
They have… They have the… they have the… the subsidy, like, interaction directly with the… With a… with a contract integrated, integrated in the… in the wallet. So they just need to click in the wallet.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
I think you can see a screenshot of that.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Hello? Yes, we can hear you.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
So I think this is the two-cot wallet, um, that…

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
In the… in the last… in the latest… let me… Check this, and…

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
refi and Salo Columbia have been supporting, um,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
the creation of and the development of, is that right?

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Yeah, but…

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Yeah.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Yeah, but there is… there is a post. In… in the acts of refined or refine Columbia, or shallow Columbia, there is a post when you… where you can see, like, the… the screenshot.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Awesome.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Of the… of their wallet. With the… with the… with… with a claim option. Okay, this is the post. Let me share with you the post. I already have time.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Yes. Feel free to share it in the chat, that'd be cool.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Uh… Okay, this is the post. If you can… if you can show this post.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000
You can see… you can see the… The Buddha in the… in the wallet to claim the subsidy.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:37.000
So, okay, people have their wallet, and if you scroll down, yeah, just click on claim your subsidi, and that's all.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Amazing. Yeah, this is super cool. I mean, I think this is… this is incredible work, because it's basically creating a direct way

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.000
So it's very easy for them.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:29:00.000
of onboarding people into the system in a way that's creating real value for them, and actually onboarding the local economy on-chain. This payment app seems like it's being adopted quite widely, even with payment merchants and local retailers, and then you're having a way for people to come and

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Uh, and validated community members can claim a sort of basic subsidy, um, as well.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Um, and even, uh, progress to getting, uh, you know, low-interest loans. So, yeah, very cool stuff. Thanks for sharing, uh, ReFi Columbia.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
crew, we should probably move on, uh,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Yeah, but just…

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
just, uh, because we've got some other people to share, but if you want to say some final words for one.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:35.000
You have to clarify. Yeah, just to clarify, Monty, it's like, okay, now we are not generating revenue for fill out the contract, but in the future, that is the idea. Like, have a source to generate revenue.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
And don't depend of donations. That is the idea in the future.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Amazing. Cool. Um, cool. Does anyone else have any… any questions related to that, or related to the presentation earlier, or anything at all?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Um, otherwise, I think we've got some other shares coming up, uh, in the agenda as well.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Um, but just open, uh…

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:05.000
That's an opportunity for any final questions.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Cool. Um…

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Well, Louise, why don't you keep sharing?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Cool, cool. So, going on to the open space for experience and knowledge sharing,

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Um, I'll pass over to Julio, uh…

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Yeah, also from Refa Barcelona, that we'll be talking about our local funding… yeah, the local funding program that we've been organizing in Catalunya with local partners.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Um, and local and global funding from these local partners, and also Localism Fund, um,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
So, yeah, if you'd like to, uh…

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Talk a bit about it, Julio. Feel free to take the lead.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Yeah. I didn't remember very much, but yeah, I also wanted to be short.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
And also because we did, I think, a very good.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000
job by documenting everything, so you can literally. Read everything we have done, and everything we are doing.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:08.000
week by week. Um… so… Basically, yeah, we're doing this funding… Planning and educational program, I think, is… As much one as the other.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
It's not just funding, it's a lot of… Training and capacitation for projects.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:21.000
By, um… getting around 12K, 12,000 euros. from local stakeholders, from these two.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Groups of cooperatives in the city of Barcelona. in Catalunya. That was matched by the localism fund contribution.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Um… and then we kind of co-design this program.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000
And yeah, just a brief word on the… Luis, you want to move the website while I talk?

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
It's actually mounted to me sharing this.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Otherwise, it's fine, but that's… Otherwise, I can also do it.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
I can do that, yes, I can do that.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Um,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
No.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Ah, okay. Cool. Great. Also not necessary, but if you do, good.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:57.000
And just a quick invitation, um, Julio. John was also going to share about the local node research. He jump at the top of the hour, um, so either, um,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Keep it 5 minutes, if possible, and then John can share, um, or even go the other way around. But yeah, maybe if you think 5 minutes is enough, then that's great, but just want to be, uh, make sure John can also share.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Yeah, I am. Cool. Um… Yeah, we engage with these two ecosystems, let's say. One is a… Um, group of associations and cooperatives in a neighborhood of Barcelona, which is the… I mean, it's a city in itself, it's very big.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:36.000
And he said, most densely populated neighborhood in. Europe. So it's a group of cooperatives and associations.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Uh… and somehow we managed to convince them to do this, even though none of them, including the lead of the.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:53.000
group. Understand anything about crypto, but… It's been a long work of, um… Engaging with them, and showing them that we are allied, and also the fact of living there.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
And saying, okay, we live here long-term. Well, I think was important.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Um, and the other group… Uh, they are this cooperative of cooperatives working in the region.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:15.000
On regeneration. across the whole spectrum of, like, cooperative, uh… housing, regenerative agriculture, consulting, they work with small, um.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
administrations… And uh… yeah, I do a bunch of stuff.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.000
I think it's one of the most interesting groups in the regions, and we're very… Honor to work with them.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
So, this program for them is something very little.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
And so it was not difficult for them to engage.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Um… and also two of the people in this.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.000
COP were, like, very interested into crypto on their own, so yeah, they were excited about testing it.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Basically, yeah, we… We convince them, and then we kind of co-design the program together, even though.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:34:00.000
All these people are very busy at the time, so… We try to engage them as much as possible, but uh… Yeah, in general, we're mostly accepting our proposal.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Um… yeah, the first part is, uh… kind of training on Web3.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:15.000
And then on Karma Gap. And the goal of this first phase is to… make all these projects, which in total are 11.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000
To… He was kind of my gap, and produce an impact report on KarmaGap.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Then the funding is dispersed. Uh, equally to all projects.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Then break… originally was Christmas break. Now we move to January. And then the second phase is more, like, on testing tools, and then we had the idea of, uh.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Using tools at a group level. So, with partners, maybe testing something like, um… I'm community, this new app that has been… It launched recently.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Um… or multi-six, or… our phone and network, like, the… I guess what economic thinks ideally, but we'll see.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
We will see, based on how the first phase go.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Um… yep, that's pretty much it. It's going okay, very difficult to engage people.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Uh… Everybody's super busy.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
undistracted, but yeah, it's going, uh, okay, a lot of learnings.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Yeah, for sure, every week we have to change what we do.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:27.000
And the plans, uh… the plans change a lot of times, but… Yeah, we're doing our best. Um, glad to answer to any question that you have in private.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
You want to reach out to me or Luis in Telegram?

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
The website is there. And that's it. Louisa, did I miss anything significant?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
That's quite perfect. Thanks a lot, Julia. Um, yeah.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
it's been personally quite a, yeah, a really big pleasure to be organizing, uh,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Okay.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
put this round together, and also…

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Um, yeah, quite nice to be working with established actors in Catalonia, uh, that have been, like, from the cooperative, uh, ecosystem.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Uh, and so on, so quite happy to be doing that.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Also, just a quick…

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:09.000
A small clarification, um, so, like, on the two phases, on the first phase, we're basically following the same, uh,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:18.000
pretty much the same process that, uh, of the region coordination, uh, DD23 round with the Karma Gap impact reporting, and then evaluation.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Uh, so, like, in the first phase, we are basically, uh, showcasing an individual level for projects, how they can, um, adopt

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:36.000
This shows, um, and then, uh, in Phase 2, at a collective level, we, uh, capacitate, like, each one of the two local networks, the two local funders,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
to manage their own, uh…

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000
yeah, the funds for Phase 2, using some of these tools, uh, also including home community.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
We're also doing a collaboration with Region Foundation, uh, to, uh,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Uh, yeah, pilot their institutional development kit as part of the Ecological Institutions book.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Uh, so that's also quite something quite cool.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Uh, but now I see that we have 5 minutes left for, uh, John to have to leave, so would you like to take the lead, uh, John?

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Uh, let me share again my slides here.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Sure, I'm not gonna take a whole 5 minutes. I actually had a brief question for you, Julio, off the back of what you shared, which is so impressive, I feel like.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
What you guys have done there is a really kind of watershed moment for the movement.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000
getting together, you know, non-Web3 actors at a bioregional level.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
But, you know, a regeneration focus.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
What do you think is the main limitation? You said people are busy.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:49.000
And people are distracted, but, like, what have you guys done that hasn't been working in terms of actually, you know, getting the attention of people you're trying to serve? I'm just curious if you can go deeper into that.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
That's a good question. I think, um, we had a very peculiar conditions.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:05.000
in terms of theme and context. Because Louise was very motivated to do it, since.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Yeah.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Out of time, and it's part of the… was part of, in a way, of the… the ecosystem and the network, so… get this kind of perspective, um… And I've been working a lot with, um…

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Okay.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
local… development notes and stuff like that. Previously, in Granada, Spain, when it's been a disaster.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Mm-hmm.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Like, in 2022, I had a disastrous experience working in another part of Spain, and I think this was the… Why it worked this time.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Okay.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Because really, it takes a lot of mistakes to… we don't, um… Andrea torto… a member of Barcelona, she's also… Very competent in a lot of ways, so I think the team was very…

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Yeah.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Objectively very experienced in a lot of. Context and domains, and we also had a good division of.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Yeah.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Or because maybe Luis is much more technically capable than the other two, maybe I'm more… I'm better than going around and networking, so it was a good combination.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Mm-mm.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Um… But I don't think it's, at the moment, it's very applicable, because it's still, like, uh… took so much time.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Yeah.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Yeah.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Hmm.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
And that's what, like, so much time and effort is… insane. Um… but yeah, it's difficult to test new things, so I guess… and thank you for the compliment.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Totally.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
a watershed moment, I think, is too much, but uh…

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Dude, I'm blown away. It looks awesome, man. And I think that's a great segue to what I offered, um, after the last call with Monty and Luis to do and support, is…

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:40.000
basically, um, yeah, my wife Fatima and I would be honored to interview a bunch of local Node leaders and understand what's working, what isn't,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Um, where do you need help, specifically? Obviously, you've got some great toolkits and resources from Luigi and Monty here, but

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Um, we want to go a bit of a layer deeper and just try and take almost an outside perspective on the state of the network and the local nodes.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.000
And also a leadership lens, so Fatima's got, uh, executive coaching and leadership background, worked with

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Snapchat and Google and some of these others. And, um, I'm all good.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
You can take your joy, no worries. Um, she's got another call in there next door.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:21.000
And the thought was that we can not only do the kind of annual local node roundup, like we've been doing in the past, but also develop a curriculum for a 2026

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
incubator or leadership program.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:30.000
And I know that ReFiDAO and Regent Coordination, these other networks, are thankfully cross-pollinating and blending, and I'd want to take

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:38.000
as broad of a view as we can to serve as many people to accelerate the impact towards their generation. Doesn't matter what we call it, in my view.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.000
And I think, um, you know, over the last 6 months, I've gone super deep into building software products with AI.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:52.000
And I would be very happy also if any local node leaders are interested in getting up to speed with Cloud Code and with some of these other toolings.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000
I think Web3 is great, uh, and it can do a lot of things, but there's also a lot of other stuff that is out there that can support regeneration.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:04.000
So, um, we have a forum post up on the ReFight Out forum.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Um, feel free to take a look and provide comments. We've got, kind of,

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:18.000
a very high-level project plan and overview. Um, would love to have some feedback and input, and basically, yeah, be a support for all you amazing local node leaders, and who knows?

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:36.000
We might make a refi Marrakesh, or, uh,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Thank you, John. Wow, I'm amazed. Thank you so much for everyone for sharing all of this. Literally.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Yesterday, we were talking with NetState, with France, about creating what is Refied out for Argentina, and these are onboarding for.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:59.000
places that already have a physical layer, but are not yet quite there in the digital ways.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000
So, all the help, if we can just join, all the people that we are doing this kind of connection.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000
It's amazing, and Monday, Luis, thank you so much for all that you have put together.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:29.000
It's outstanding, like, it's literally… I've been dreaming about having that for the past 3 years, and now I see this, and I'm like, wow, this was fast, this is amazing! So… Thank you, thank you so much. And anyone that is interested in this, please talk to us, to France, to the next stage. We are, like.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
hard open and mind open to make this happen.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Amazing, thanks so much for that.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Oh, amazing, what beautiful energy and vibes to bring, uh…

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
to this moment in the call. I appreciate you coming and sharing.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.000
And very excited. I was… it was amazing to come to Argentina and meet, uh, meet you all there.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.000
And spend a month together in Patagonia, in the regen house, and really understand the local

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.000
context and meet the community there, so I'm really grateful for that, and exciting to see how it's following up and emerging.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000
And, uh, and growing from that seed.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Um, so yeah, awesome stuff, and goodbye, John!

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Are you… I have a… can I have a quick comment of 30 seconds that I forgot to add?

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Yes.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:26.000
I think it was, um… I think that, yeah, um, what we did in Barcelona, in Catonia, has been cool, but it's also been limited by the fact that most people don't give a about crypto.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:33.000
And maybe I'm also against it? And there's this kind of cultural aversion to it, and also sort of laziness related to wealth.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:41.000
And also with the fact that. the financial infrastructure here is kind of functional, and the currency is stable.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Uh, nobody is starving, pretty much, but I think it would be much easier to do this.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Kind of things and programs. in the cities in the Global South, for example.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Because there, you actually have a use case for stablecoins, which is.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:03.000
very clear, and I think, um… Organization would be much, uh, more inclined to participate, because it's useful.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000
They need it. Um, yeah, it was kind of annoying stay here with.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
projects and having to convince them that this technology one day would be useful to something.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:25.000
So, um, yeah, I think things could get a lot of traction in the global south in this sense. Then, I don't know, maybe Luis disagrees, but uh… I'm usually defending Robot South, and he's like, hmm, actually, not so much, uh…

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Yeah, they just want to add that. I think in Argentina, for example, that is becoming a crypto hub, and the currency is crazy.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Yeah, totally.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000
You can do a lot of stuff more.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Yeah, in Argentina, we're very, like, open to all of this, and everyone is already on board, so just creating a new system, because, well, if you know our politics, you know what I'm talking about.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.000
So, it's… the vibe is already here.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Amazing, love that, and I think there's a definitely interesting reflections. Um, yeah, we're at the top of the hour, so if anyone's got to drop, uh, then feel free to, um, but Louise, correct me if I'm wrong, we still have a little bit more time if we want… if anyone else wanted to share some stuff, or is that what you… what are you thinking?

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Yes, exactly. So, we would have an extra 30 minutes, so we can have if there'd be more discussion topics to then, and then basically, like, end to…

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.000
We're over. Uh, but actually, I wanted to suggest now, uh, that we're actually already a bit over the top of the hour.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Uh, to take a screenshot of, like, uh, if people would like to take a pic… uh, to open the cameras, uh, and then we can, like, make some funny posts and take a picture.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Um, and that'd be a nice moment.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Alright, if you stop your screen share, and then if we all get our cameras on, uh, we can do our classic…

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:51.000
And of course, celebrations. I'm gonna wait for a few more cameras coming on, I wanna see some smiling faces.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
build up some hype, like, hey, you ready? 3…

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000
2… 1… let's go!

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:04.000
And now, one more! 3, 2, 1… yes!

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Alright, beautiful. Oh, I see more faces coming. Okay, we're gonna have to do one more, we're gonna have to do one more to get as many people as possible.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:16.000
3, 1! Yeah, it's…

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000
No.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Alright, beautiful. That's lovely to see everyone's faces from across the globe, all connecting here.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Beautiful.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Yeah, thank you for…

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Um, with that hope, does anyone feel, and all the awesome things that have been shared so far, um, does anyone feel called that they want to share a little bit about what they've been doing with their refi node, or other projects that relate to this?

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:47.000
And share a bit with others here on this call. I think we could at least go another 5, 5-10 minutes, uh, if people wanted to share. Uh, but also happy to…

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000
So, and if that's not the case, but…

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Just offering that. Silvio!

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Yeah, Monty, uh, I love this. Thanks so much, guys, for… for hosting this, this really helps us.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
stay on track, move the ball forward, stay more organized, stay more professional, which.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000
We really need, um, uh, in every way, so thank you, and this has been amazing.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:17.000
I also want to give a shout-out to Luis. Luis, the resource tool, taking the open source approach.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Um, I think so, certainly in the ethos of, I think, everything we're standing for here.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
And as somebody that's kind of been paying for all their expenses the last 2 or 3 years.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:33.000
I especially appreciate it, um, because we're paying the expenses, we're not even leveraging the assets, so… So that's just very valuable.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Uh, my updates, I think, on my side. I'm going to limit it to kind of three things.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Number one is, we've been working on legacy gardens, so… working with the historic Black churches in West Coconut Grove here in Miami.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:55.000
to do community gardens with the churches. For food security, and we have been supporting a local nonprofit called EcoPlanet Earth.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
To do that, we started at the end of last year, we built our first garden this year.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
And now we're expanding that. We were able to get the city on board to give a grant, the county on board to give a grant.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000
you know, hustled a lot to give, like, pick up free trees and stuff, and plant them.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Uh, and then we scan them, we tried to do an eco-cert.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:23.000
with Dean Forrest. Um, didn't end up minting it, because we want to make sure that we have an MOU in place with that other non-profit, just to make sure everything is super kosher.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000
So we didn't pull the trigger, but we did invite the team to the green pill call.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Yesterday, so they could learn more about this, because, you know, they don't… a lot of these folks don't really understand the tech side of what we're trying to do.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:41.000
for the validation, but that legacy garden is a big… has been one of the big focuses for us this year.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:49.000
The other has been in the blue economy. So, one with coral restoration, we worked with the local high schools.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:59.000
And, uh, and local foundation. And, uh, dive clubs, and… to do coral restoration efforts. We asked the different high school students to make art.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Um, related to… and I could… I could even maybe show us.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000
show some things here. Uh, we got asked to make some art.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Um, and so we added all these students, put some art together, and then when they did the art, we were able to go, and the idea is connect that art.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:23.000
to benefit the Students for Coral Preservation Foundation. And then we would have, like, a proof of choral protocol in the end, is kind of what we're… what we're gunning for.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000
But at least we're kind of starting to do that nature-based solution emphasis.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Um, and then lastly, I've been fighting. I've been fighting a lot.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:38.000
with policy in the city of Miami. as the appointee to the Climate Resilience Committee, because the city.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
And the politicians have been trying to pass legislations that make it easier to cut trees down.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:49.000
to be… to do bigger developments. And so the community got up at arms, we partnered with the Sierra Club.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
Um, and we were able to… to fight and win.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:57.000
and remove some of that legislation that was going to damage our city and our goals to.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:03.000
reach 30% canopy. As well as think about new policies to incentivize smart development.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000
How do we incentivize if you need to go up.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Right? And you're saving 100 square feet, 300 square feet.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000
How do we give a bonus to developers that actually keep those trees in place?

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:20.000
to be able to up that, and then if we… and then to update also tree mitigation tables, as well as to pilot.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:26.000
putting… we have a tree trust fund, so when people cut the tree down, they have to put money into a tree trust fund.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000
How do we explore bringing the Tree Trust Fund on-chain?

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Right? And so that's one of the goals we are trying to align with the government blockchain association as well. So those are the three things, really excited. Monty, it was wonderful meeting you.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:44.000
During EuroClimate week as well. you're super tall, um, uh, and to see that background with you and my girlfriend, you guys.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:50.000
sharing some friends and background and comments. quite lovely, white, really magical, working with the region.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.000
very touching, um, hopefully I can… I can join you guys and we can do more.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000
But those are the updates on my side with Refine Miami.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Again, we've been… we launched our foundation, we have the foundation, Logos Impact Foundation Incubating.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Refine Miami, so we have, like, an official legal entity.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:14.000
to apply for grants. We also tried, um… through Scott Morris, shout out to Scott, which is not on this call, um, Scott, as you know, Monty.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.000
work with us to try to mediate and support us in many other ways to move the ball forward.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000
We worked with, um, I think it's… what is that group out of the UK?

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:28.000
that has, uh, tree intelligence, a tree intelligence, um.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:35.000
focus. We, uh, Dark Matter Labs. So, at my firm and Dark Matter Labs worked on an MOU.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:42.000
In the beginning of the year to find out how do we fund this, how do we get more grants, and then do something more institutional for regenerative finance instruments.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000
in partnership, in concert with them. So, I'd love to open that up.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:51.000
And lastly, we collaborated with Mexico. One of our biodiversity projects.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:57.000
We're doing the first biodiversity credits project initiative. Logos Capital, my firm.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:04.000
is part of the Biodiversity Credits Alliance. And so, there's a UNESCO World Heritage Site out of Mexico City called.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Sochimilco, which has an endangered species there that depends on water quality.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
So we're building the first kind of biodiversity credits with regen.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Um, uh, water quality credits. And will you be using, like, drones and creating a water ledger from that?

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.000
which hopefully serves as an example for the United Nations Development Program.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:29.000
And biofin, the bioregional finance facility. of the UN in concert. So those are my updates. It's really great.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Talk about refi everywhere we go, so folks know about it.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Um, really love this community, and congrats on all of you for.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:43.000
being here, for sticking it through, and for resourcing others that are trying to do their best. So, thank you guys so much. It's certainly an encouragement.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
To be part of this collective. Over.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.000
That's amazing. Wow, lots of incredible updates and exciting stuff there, Sylvia. Thanks for…

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Thanks for sharing that with us all.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Um, and… yeah, I saw, Sandra, you had your hand up as well. I think you're in the…

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.000
the crypto Refi Cafe, uh, that I've been to visit.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Ah yes. Hello!

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000
And I think you also just had Jimmy over as well.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Yeah, it's been quite exciting. It's just been, uh, going, going, going, but, um, very exciting for us. You know, last year, we were really diligent about.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.000
doing monthly cleanups, we were going to a place called Shankan for monthly Earth Day, and.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Um, this year, we started to expand, um, all of those, uh, events into also educational events, so we've been doing.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Basically, we started during World Ocean Day, and then, um, you know, got some requests to continue doing ocean-focused events, and then moved into, you know, just.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:46.000
regular refi, it's now called… we rebranded, it's called Refi Horizons.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:52.000
And, um, you were the first, Monty, and so it was great to have you here and introduce you to.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:54:06.000
The Tulum community, and I think that there's a real opportunity there. We've also been expanding beyond refi. How do we get funding? How do we keep this organization going? And one of the things that I've found to be.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Um, at least promising in terms of, you know, delivering.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.000
funds that we need are the scholarship and… not scholarship, the sponsorship route.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:22.000
And so, we've been, you know, getting a lot of our cleanup sponsored and then expanding that into the events.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.000
And then also just being able to provide a platform for people that are curious.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000
to connect around refi, to ask their questions, and yeah, there's still a lot of that.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Crypto hesitancy, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Um, but there's people that also, you know, do understand and are open to it, and are really curious about how it can apply to their own efforts. We just did.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:51.000
The refi horizons with Jimmy in a place called Bacalar, which is a beautiful lagoon that has, like, the origins of life.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000
The stromotoletes, and so that was really incredible, and I think just.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Nice.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000
yeah, like, you know, being… doing a lot more.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Networking with other organizations that are on the ground and kind of opening their eyes to how they can, you know, find these additional mechanisms of funding and community and growth.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:16.000
So, yeah, there's a lot of curiosity about that. I think that, um, sometime next year, it would make sense for us to do.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:23.000
you know, a similar around for the refi projects around the space. And it's also funny to run into people that are like.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:35.000
wow, like, you're so refi because you're just… you just went rogue, and you did something, like, there's this group called, uh, the, um… Mision voyado, and what they did is they saw that, you know, the growth of.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:45.000
The growth of, um, this area in terms of tourism has really, you know, been endangering these organisms, which are called those thromotolites, and also the mangroves, and so.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:54.000
They just, like, started to block off these areas, like, create these partitions and ropes, and they studied, you know, what was the right kind of matter to use for the ropes and material and.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Um, and, you know, so they put these themselves together, and they've, like, almost protected, like, 75% of the area that they identified. I was like, wow, this is… You're so refi! But, um, you know, so there's so many things like that that are happening on the ground here, and it's been just really…

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Wonderful to use this as a platform to connect, and also another thing that we were, like, at least a lot of the people here locally.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:32.000
have been part of is this, uh, Latin American accelerator called MIMA, and it's just been super helpful in terms of… I mean, I come from a Silicon Valley startup background, so a lot of these things I should know, but just to be in a group that is.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Going through, like, you know, what is, um, you know, what is your Canvas be? What is, you know, like, I think we did a lot of that, you know, in our initial.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:49.000
Um, in our initial cohort, uh, you know, getting off the ground, but coming back to those things after being in operation and kind of figuring out what are the things that are working.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:56.000
Where do we see, you know, the monetization, you know, really being promising? And so, yeah, I think that, um.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Yes, we've learned a lot, and I think we've kind of come to a place where we now understand.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.000
It's, you know, what our true MVP is in terms of this.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:13.000
Um, platform for connecting, um, all of these, uh, different refi initiatives, and also finding funding for them.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:22.000
And also, for us, being that. Scouts, the intermediary scout that can connect VCs to, um, you know, these new technologies.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:31.000
Um, and help them accelerate, so… Um, yeah, you know, really excited about everything that we've had going on, and um, yeah, of course, like, meeting.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:40.000
wonderful people in person, like Monty and Jimmy, and um, yeah, you know, just kind of, like, having fun while we're doing it. We also, uh.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:46.000
also got a coral regeneration experience off the ground as well while Jimmy was here.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:51.000
And so, yeah, and that's, like, partnered with a local nonprofit called Oceanis.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:58:02.000
So, so much going on. I want to connect with you, too. On, uh, Miami stuff and what you're doing with the Excelote. That's so amazing.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Um, for those of you that don't know, the endangered species or animal that is in that lagoon is this.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:16.000
really cute little amphibious. creature that is, like, it just looks so adorable. It looks like it has, like, a happy smiley face on it, and it's got these little prints.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000
like a real Pokemon.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:44.000
And it's pink, and it's just so cute! So, yeah, that's so awesome that you're doing that. Um, so yeah, we've been, um, yeah, working hard over here and coming to some, um, you know, good realizations about where, um, we need to focus in terms of a business, uh, and, you know, not, um, depending fully on, you know, refi money, although I think that the magic intermittent money is still there. That's what.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:50.000
You know, we know that we'll be able to, you know, make a living and, you know, be doing good for the planet.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Uh, you know, soon, it's just the beginning, so I have full faith in that, but in the meantime, we still have to.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:01.000
supplement our efforts with, you know, other sources of funding, which there are. There's so many sources of funding out there.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:06.000
And it's just a matter of presenting yourself in the right way and having the right offering that people.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:22.000
want to, um, purchase. Right? And so that means, like, having a proper deck, having proper PDFs and one-sheets about what your offerings are and, you know, getting the right logos in place, and yeah, so it's been a lot of fun, a lot of learnings, and I'm really excited for.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.000
where we are and what's to come.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Amazing! Thank you, Sandra, for sharing.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.000
Awesome stuff, awesome vibes.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000
Mm-hmm.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Amazing, Sandra. And shout out, Sandra, you've been a real rock star, always the DAOs within the refi network, most closely aligned to us, and wanting to collab, and… You know, you and I met before ReFi DAO launched, and you've been doing this work a long time.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.000
OG, OG.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Holding it down. And with the Crypto Cafe, and NFTs and everything, with the plastics recycling, and.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000
You know, you just, you know, you're really about it, you live and breathe this, Sandra, you really walk the talk in an incredible way.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Yes.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Yeah.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
So I just want to honor you, and because… and thank you, because you, you know, you're one of these.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Thank you, so we have.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000
sparks that, uh, that's doing the right thing, so really grateful for you.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
100%.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Uh… Yeah, let's talk about collaborations, and, you know, I really love the whole, uh, you know, the events have been really wonderful in terms of bringing people together and just creating really magical.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
moments, you know, like around the fire, Monty, when it was raining.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Yeah, the lightning going down. It was an incredible, it was such a nice week. Honestly, if anyone here wants to go, uh, have an excuse to go visit Tulum, Sandra is the most wonderful host, and I'm sure she'd be very happy. Um, and…

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:44.000
It's always fun to, like, create events, you know, honestly, like, I think that that's been super fun, just to be able to create events and introduce, you know, you guys to our communities.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Uh, and yeah, like, I mean, you guys are… everyone is doing amazing things, and I think that, like, it also helps us spark that interest within our community, like, who's these, who are these characters coming into Tulum?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Why are we… why are we doing an event around them? So, um, yeah, this has been very fun.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Amazing. Cool. Thanks so much for sharing. Um, I think…

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I think we're coming… coming towards the end of wrapping up the call. I think now is the last moment, if you're desperate to share and want to share a little bit, then quickly raise your hand.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Um, otherwise, I think we might, uh, wrap the call for today. I'm gonna grab some lunch, and…

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Yes, exactly.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I see Louise is sharing screen. Oh, and grab the Po app as well. Make sure… I think about 6 people have done that so far.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Um, download the PoApp Home app.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Uh, on iPhone or Android, and then, yes, look, you can see it here on the screen.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Um, just as a fun celebration, uh, for your attendance here.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
And our time together.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Yes, exactly.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Oh, look, there's a QR code, that's quite handy.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
You can use a QR code, that may make things easier.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Um, and then also, just quickly, I hope nobody's trying to scan the QR code right now.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Um, but just wanted to share, um…

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Actually, first of all, thank, uh, thank you all a lot for joining, and, like, the session today and being part of the network, and actually making ReFiDAO, um,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Yeah, B, something.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Um, and then, just wanted to share a couple of quick

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
follow-ups, um…

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:24.000
So, one is that, as Monty mentioned, we'll be sharing a thread on the region coordination hub, uh, so on RIFADAO's Forum.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Uh, for doing a quick retrospective of 2025 and vision for 2026, so if you'd have anything that you'd like to share, or, like, ideas for 2026,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
There, um, yeah, that'd be the place to do it.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Um, also, we do have the local nodes, leads, telegram group, so if you'd like, yeah, if you'd have any additional, like, questions, or would need support with that.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Um, and also just wanted to bring the possibility that we've been considering doing, uh, some not-so-structured, but a bit more loose, um, work, like, recurrent, uh, support works.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000
For local nodes, we could try to do it monthly in 2026.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:15.000
But, yeah, basically, uh, have this open space where local nodes can come, uh, bring questions, challenges, experiences, like what they've been working on, and so on.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Uh, it's really, really nice to be connecting with you all, uh, like, as today, so it could be nice to do it more.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Uh, and yeah, uh, do anyone have anything else that they'd like to share, uh, before we close off the call?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Yeah, otherwise, then I'd just like to thank everyone again, um, yeah, it was really nice.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Uh, and yeah, we show some good holidays, uh, and looking forward to seeing the network growing.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Yes, thank you so much, everyone. Thanks for coming. Uh, feel free to unmute and just say goodbye, and then we'll end the call.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
As we all drop off.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Goodbye! Happy holidays, everyone!

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
All right. Bye, guys. Bye-bye.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Happy holidays! Happy New Year! Hello!

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Bye guys, thank you. It was very inspiring.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Have a great Christmas!

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Api Holloway.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Thanks, bye bye.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
We'll see you in 2026. Let's go!

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Let's…

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Let's go!

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Let's make 2026 the year of the refi comeback.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Very nice to see you guys. Ciao!

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Goodbye, goodbye. Ciao, chiao, ciao.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Bye!

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Thank you. Take time.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Mm-hmm.
