# Thread Content

gm gm local noders! ☀️🌱

As we approach the end of 2025 — and having just gathered last week for the **Local Nodes End-of-Year Support Workshop** — we wanted to open this thread as a space for our network to reflect on the year and share thoughts on where we're headed in 2026.

Our intention is to surface reflections from Local Node leaders and network members, so that your insights can directly inform how we co-develop the network for 2026.

## Updated onboarding guide and resources for Local Nodes  📚

Over the past months, we've been focused on making the Local Node experience more streamlined and supportive:

- **🔄 Simplified onboarding process**: A new form-based application flow with clearer step-by-step guidance from initial interest to full activation.
- **🎨 Enhanced resources**: Updated Local Node resources for practical execution, including the [Local Node Toolkit](https://www.notion.so/Local-Node-Toolkit-v1-5-2aebf304370a81c5ba33d3794285d322?pvs=21), the [Local Node Canvas](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1220731037056160873) for strategic planning, and expanded brand/design templates.
- **💰 Funding pools active**: Local Nodes can access the Kickstarter Pool (up to 500 USDGLO), managed through [ReFi DAO’s Garden](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens/42220/0x4f604735c1cf31399c6e711d5962b2b3e0225ad3/0x13e71c56c5b048e9b8b6a9dbb4a4f346b5dab986).
- **🌐 Website template (alpha)**: A free, self-hosted Local Node website template built on Quartz—already live for [ReFi Barcelona](https://refibcn.cat/) and [Regenerant Catalunya](https://regenerant.cat/), with more nodes currently testing it.

## Some points for reflection **🌠**

Feel free to share your reflections across different perspectives, following the model from the [Regen Coordination End of Year Reflections](https://hub.regencoordination.xyz/t/regen-coordination-end-of-year-reflections/378/3) – *from your specific local node and personal endeavors, to ReFi DAO & other local nodes, and the wider network. (optional)*

### → What were key highlights to you in 2025 ←

### → What were key challenges to you in 2025 ←

### → Visions for 2026 ←

*Note:* We also look to tie these reflections into the potential **[2025 Local Node Roundup Research, Insights & Playbooks](https://hub.regencoordination.xyz/t/proposal-feedback-2025-local-node-roundup-research-insights-playbooks/376)** initiative, proposed by John and Fatma.

## Next steps – *January sense-making & planning for 2026*

Over January, Monty and I will be working to translate these collective visions into actionable plans — gradually involving other ReFi DAO Global contributors, Local Node leaders, and wider community members. We look forward to your input! ✨

Looking forward to hearing from you all – and wish you all good holidays! 💫
