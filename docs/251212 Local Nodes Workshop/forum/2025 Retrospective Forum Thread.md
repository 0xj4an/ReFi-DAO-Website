# PART 1: Thread Opening Post

## Thread Title

**ReFi Local Nodes - End of Year Retrospective & 2026 Vision 🌠**

---

## Thread Content

Hello ReFi Local Node Leaders and Community! 👋

As we approach the end of 2025, we're opening this space for our network to reflect on the year and share thoughts on where we're headed in 2026.

This thread comes on the heels of our **Local Nodes End-of-Year Support Workshop** (December 12), where we brought together node leaders from Colombia, Argentina, Spain, Mexico, France, the Netherlands, Miami, and beyond. The full workshop summary is posted below as the first reply.

Our intention here is to surface reflections from Local Node leaders and other network members — so that your insights can inform how we co-develop the network for 2026.

Over January, Monty and I will be working to translate these collective visions into actionable plans — gradually involving other ReFi DAO Global contributors, Local Node leaders, and wider community members. We look forward to your input! ✨

### We Want to Hear From You 💬

Whether you're an active Local Node leader, just getting started, or thinking about forming a node, we'd love your reflections on three areas:

- What developments excited you across ReFi DAO, other local nodes, or the wider network?

**2. Key Challenges in 2025**
- What obstacles did you face locally?
- What gaps or friction did you notice at the network level?

**3. Visions for 2026**
- What do you want to achieve with your node or in your local context?
- What would you like to see from ReFi DAO and the network as a whole?

# PART 2: First Reply - Workshop Summary

## December 12 Workshop Recap 📋

Here's what we covered in the workshop:

---

### Updated Onboarding Guide + Resources 📚

Over the past months, we've been focused on making the Local Node experience more streamlined and supportive:

- **🔄 Simplified onboarding process**: A new form-based application flow with clearer step-by-step guidance from initial interest to full activation.
- **🎨 Enhanced resources**: Updated Local Node resources for practical execution, including the [Local Node Toolkit v1.5](https://www.notion.so/refi-dao/Local-Node-Toolkit-v1-5-2aebf304370a81c5ba33d3794285d322), the [Local Node Canvas](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1220731037056160873) for strategic planning, and expanded brand/design templates.
- **💰 Funding pools active**: Local Nodes can access the Kickstarter Pool (up to 500 USDGLO), managed through [ReFi DAO's Garden](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens/42220/0x4f604735c1cf31399c6e711d5962b2b3e0225ad3/0x13e71c56c5b048e9b8b6a9dbb4a4f346b5dab986).
- **🌐 Website template (alpha)**: A free, self-hosted Local Node website template built on Quartz—already live for [ReFi Barcelona](https://refibcn.cat/) and [Regenerant Catalunya](https://regenerant.cat/), with more nodes currently testing it.

### Node Spotlights

**🇨🇴 ReFi Colombia** (Wairamoon & Juan)
UBI-like subsidy program expanding from Medellín nationwide. Verified members claim subsidies every 7 days in CCOP (on-chain Colombian peso). Integrated into TuCo wallet — one click to claim.
→ [subsidios.reficolombia.org](https://subsidios.reficolombia.org/)

**🇪🇸 ReFi Barcelona** (Giulio & Luizfernando)
Regenerant Catalunya funding program: €12K from local cooperatives matched by Localism Fund. 11 projects in two phases — Web3/KarmaGap training, then collective tool testing. Piloting Regen Foundation's Institutional Development Kit.
→ [regenerant.refibcn.cat](https://regenerant.refibcn.cat/)

**🇺🇸 ReFi Miami** (Silvio)

### Key Insights

1. **Global South advantage** — Crypto has clear use cases where currencies are unstable. Harder to convince people in Europe where finance "works."

2. **Open source saves money** — Website template costs $10/year vs. hundreds monthly on SaaS.

3. **Physical presence builds trust** — Living in the community long-term was key to getting cooperatives on board.

4. **Team diversity matters** — Successful nodes have complementary skills (technical, networking, coordination).

5. **"ReFi" is happening without us** — People doing regenerative work on the ground who've never heard of Web3. Our job is to connect and support.
