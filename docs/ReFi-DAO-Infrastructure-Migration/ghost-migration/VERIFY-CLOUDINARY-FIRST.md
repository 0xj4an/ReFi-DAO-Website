# Verify Cloudinary First - Then Fix Storage

## Step 1: Check if Cloudinary Adapter is Installed

In Railway dashboard:

1. **Go to Deployments tab**
2. **Click on latest deployment**
3. **Check build logs** for:
   - ✅ `npm install ghost-storage-cloudinary` (should appear)
   - ✅ Build completes successfully
   - ❌ Any errors?

**If you see the npm install, Cloudinary adapter IS installed!** ✅

---

## Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

Railway → Variables tab, check these exact variable names exist:

```
storage__active=cloudinary
storage__cloudinary__cloud_name=dvrjmfhzw
storage__cloudinary__api_key=416117346651538
storage__cloudinary__api_secret=otyj18N2l3plqMGTMWum177FYzc
```

**All 4 must be present with exact names!**

---

## Step 3: The Real Issue

Even with Cloudinary configured, Ghost might be:
- Writing logs to local storage
- Writing temporary files locally
- The volume is full from previous uploads

**Solution:** We need to free up space OR ensure Cloudinary handles everything.

## Alternative: Recreate Service (Safest if Volume Not Found)

Since we can't find the volume, let's recreate the service with a fresh start:

### Step 1: Export Configuration

1. **Copy all environment variables** from Railway → Variables
2. **Note your settings** (domain, database connection, etc.)

### Step 2: Create New Ghost Service

1. **Railway Dashboard** → Your project
2. **Click "+ New"** → **"Service"**
3. **Select "GitHub Repo"**
4. **Choose:** `ReFi-DAO-Website` repo
5. **Set Root Directory:** `ghost-railway`
6. **Set Branch:** `docs`

### Step 3: Configure New Service

1. **Add all environment variables** (copy from old service)
2. **Add Cloudinary variables** (already have them)
3. **Connect to same MySQL database**
4. **Railway will build from Dockerfile**

### Step 4: Delete Old Service

1. **Old Ghost service** → **Settings** → **Danger Zone**
2. **Delete service** (database stays safe - it's separate)
3. **New service starts fresh** with empty volume + Cloudinary ✅

---

## Why This Works

- ✅ **Fresh volume** = no storage issues
- ✅ **Cloudinary configured** = all new storage goes there
- ✅ **Database separate** = all data safe
- ✅ **Same configuration** = everything works the same

## Quick Check First

Before recreating, let's verify:

1. **In Railway → Latest deployment logs:**
   - Do you see `npm install ghost-storage-cloudinary`?
   - Yes → Cloudinary is installed, just need to fix storage
   - No → Need to fix Dockerfile/build first

2. **In Railway → Variables:**
   - Are all 4 Cloudinary variables present?
   - Yes → Configuration is correct
   - No → Need to add them

Share what you see in the deployment logs, and we'll proceed accordingly!
