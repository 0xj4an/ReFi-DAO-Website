# How to Get Cloudinary Credentials

## Step 1: Log into Cloudinary Dashboard

1. Go to https://cloudinary.com/console
2. Log in with your account

## Step 2: Find Your Credentials

Once logged in, you'll see your dashboard. Look for:

### Option A: Dashboard Homepage
- Your **Cloud Name** is displayed prominently at the top
- It looks like: `dxyz1234` or `your-account-name`

### Option B: Account Details
1. Click on your account/profile icon (top right)
2. Go to **Account Details** or **Settings**
3. You'll see:
   - **Cloud Name** (e.g., `dxyz1234`)
   - **API Key** (e.g., `123456789012345`)
   - **API Secret** (click "Reveal" to show it)

### Option C: Product Environment Credentials
1. In the dashboard, look for **Product Environment Credentials** section
2. You'll see all three values there

## What You Need

Copy these three values:

1. **Cloud Name** - Usually something like `dxyz1234`
2. **API Key** - A long number like `123456789012345`
3. **API Secret** - A long string like `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456`

## Security Note

⚠️ **Keep your API Secret private!** Don't share it publicly or commit it to public repositories.

## Next Step

Once you have these three values, provide them and I'll help configure Railway!
