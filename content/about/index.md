# About ReFi DAO

## Mission Statement

**Mission: Building a global regenerative economy, rooted in local communities.**

ReFi DAO's mission is to regenerate the Earth by catalysing **regenerative economies** at local, bioregional, and global scale. To get there, we aim to scale the **Regenerative Finance (ReFi) movement** and empower communities in co-creating a future rooted in social equity, economic opportunity, and ecological restoration.

## Vision

**Vision: A Network Society to Regenerate the Earth.**

In the face of cascading global challenges, we do not despair. We envision a **regenerative paradigm**. A transformative future where community, finance, and technology work in synergy towards ecological and social harmony.

## Opportunity of a Just Transition

The Paris Agreement's net-zero 2050 target represents an economic opportunity of approximately $240 trillion involved in transitioning from extractive to regenerative economies.

This transition requires new models of finance, governance, and community coordination that prioritize regeneration over extraction.

## Capital Flows & Coordination

Climate change is a coordination problem. New tools can unlock significant funding flows toward regenerative initiatives.

Through regenerative finance (ReFi), we're building the infrastructure to direct capital toward projects that restore ecosystems, strengthen communities, and create sustainable economic systems.

## Network Structure

ReFi DAO operates as a **network society** that operates across multiple levels from global to local. The organizational structure combines decentralized autonomy with clear structure, connectivity, and a collective mission, vision, values, identity. This aims to allow for diverse initiatives to flourish while ensuring alignment and integration with the broader mission and values of ReFi DAO.

- **ReFi DAO Global** is the core coordination and governance body for the ReFi DAO Network. It facilitates the creation of key high-level documentation and strategic plans to be ratified by governance. From there, it is responsible for network level financial management and execution of core operations, as well as providing support and oversight to various local and thematic initiatives while empowering them to operate autonomously.

- **Local Nodes** are autonomous, place-based communities that experiment with, implement, and innovate regenerative finance (ReFi) in their respective regions. These nodes are self-governing, while maintaining alignment with the broader mission, values, and charter of ReFi DAO.

- **Network Initiatives** are autonomous projects, guilds, or working groups that align with the mission, vision, values, and identity of ReFi DAO. These initiatives operate independently with their own teams, resources, and structures, while maintaining coherence with the broader network's goals and brand identity. They may also receive financial support and guidance from ReFi DAO Global.

- **Network Members** signal alignment with ReFi DAO's vision, mission, and values by signing the Community Covenant. This entry-level membership empowers access to basic resources, participation in discussions and opportunities to contribute.
