# ReFi DAO Community Garden

> 🌱
>
> *Welcome to ReFi DAO's decentralized funding platform! This guide introduces our Gardens-based funding pools that support new Local Nodes and innovative network initiatives through democratic conviction voting.*

# Introduction

Gardens has been integrated as one of ReFi DAO's core infrastructure tools, enabling our community to fund regenerative initiatives through democratic conviction-based voting. During GG23, we secured matching funds from the [Gitcoin Gardens round](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-garden-gg23-retrospective/20720) to boost our funding capacity.

## 💧 What is Gardens?

[**Gardens**](https://www.gardens.fund/) is a decentralized funding platform that enables communities to democratically fund projects through **conviction voting**. It's designed specifically for web3 ecosystems working on public goods, providing tools to coordinate, make decisions, and govern resources with an emphasis on healthy, open, and democratic community experiences.

**How Gardens Funding Works:**

- Members allocate voting power to support proposals they believe in
- Support grows stronger over time (50% every 7 days)
- Sustained backing carries more weight than quick decisions
- When proposals reach the threshold, they get funded automatically
- The system rewards genuine, persistent community support and prevents last-minute manipulation
