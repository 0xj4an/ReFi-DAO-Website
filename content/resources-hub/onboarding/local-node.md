## Introduction

<aside>
👋

*Welcome, future ReFi leader! This guide will walk you through the journey of becoming an officially recognized ReFi Local Node within our network society. By taking these steps, you're joining a global movement dedicated to regenerating the Earth through community-driven, place-based action.* 

</aside>

📍

### What is a ReFi Local Node?

A ReFi Local Node is a **place-based community** that serves as a living laboratory for regenerative finance in your region. As described in [ReFi DAO Network - Structure, Roles, & Governance](https://www.notion.so/ReFi-DAO-Network-Structure-Roles-Governance-2aebf304370a81f9a306f3dd1657f1ce?pvs=21), ReFi Local Nodes:

- **Build local regenerative economies** through events, media, software, capital raising, and land projects.
- **Experiment with and implement** ReFi tools and systems.
- **Operate with regional autonomy** while maintaining alignment with ReFi DAO's global vision, mission and values, see [ReFi DAO Community Covenant V1](https://www.notion.so/ReFi-DAO-Community-Covenant-V1-2aebf304370a81b0b78bead4a059d964?pvs=21).
- **Share knowledge and learnings** with the broader network to accelerate collective impact.

### Core Principles of the Network

As you embark on this journey, remember that ReFi DAO operates on principles of:

- **Decentralized Autonomy with Collaborative Alignment** - You'll have the freedom to shape your Local Node according to your region's unique needs while staying connected to our global mission.
- **Mutual Reciprocity** - Our network thrives when value flows in both directions — Local Nodes receive support *and* contribute back through knowledge, visibility, capital, or co-created tools.
- **Transparency and Accountability** - Regular reporting and open communication ensure we all learn and grow together.
- **Regenerative Leadership** - We embrace cycles of growth, composting, and renewal, allowing our network to evolve naturally.

### Develop your Local Node's unique brand & graphics

---

ReFi DAO provides a set of customizable graphics, to be adapted for your local node’s specific context. Fork and customize branding templates for your Local Node, ensure visual consistency while reflecting your local identity.

**How to use the templates:**

- **Duplicate the Figma board/file** into your own workspace
- Rename it to your node (e.g., “ReFi [Location] — Brand Kit”)
- Make all edits in your duplicate (so the original templates stay clean for the network)

You’ll be able to create variations for: ***logo • cover image • event banners • social posts • ReFi DAO design assets • more.***
