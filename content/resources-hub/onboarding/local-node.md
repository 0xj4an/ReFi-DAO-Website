# Starting a ReFi Local Node - Onboarding Guide

> 👋
>
> *Welcome, future ReFi leader! This guide will walk you through the journey of becoming an officially recognized ReFi Local Node within our network society. By taking these steps, you're joining a global movement dedicated to regenerating the Earth through community-driven, place-based action.* 

# Introduction

### 📍 What is a ReFi Local Node?

A ReFi Local Node is a **place-based community** that serves as a living laboratory for regenerative finance in your region. As described in [[../documents/network-structure|ReFi DAO Network - Structure, Roles, & Governance]], ReFi Local Nodes:

- **Build local regenerative economies** through events, media, software, capital raising, and land projects.
- **Experiment with and implement** ReFi tools and systems, see ‣.
- **Operate with regional autonomy** while maintaining alignment with ReFi DAO's global vision, mission and values, see [[../documents/community-covenant|ReFi DAO Community Covenant V1]] .
- **Share knowledge and learnings** with the broader network to accelerate collective impact.
    - ‣

### 🪷 Core Principles of the Network

As you embark on this journey, remember that ReFi DAO operates on principles of:

- **Decentralized Autonomy with Collaborative Alignment** - You'll have the freedom to shape your Local Node according to your region's unique needs while staying connected to our global mission.
- **Mutual Reciprocity** - Our network thrives when value flows in both directions — Local Nodes receive support *and* contribute back through knowledge, visibility, capital, or co-created tools.
- **Transparency and Accountability** - Regular reporting and open communication ensure we all learn and grow together.
- **Regenerative Leadership** - We embrace cycles of growth, composting, and renewal, allowing our network to evolve naturally.

### 🧭 Your Journey Ahead

The onboarding guide that follows outlines a clear pathway to establish your Local Node, from initial alignment to full activation. The process is designed to ensure you:

1. **Align with ReFi DAO's shared mission and values,** as outlined in our [[../documents/community-covenant|ReFi DAO Community Covenant V1]].
2. **Understand the commitments and benefits** detailed in the [[../documents/local-node-membership-agreement|ReFi DAO Local Node Membership Agreement v1]] .
3. **Receive initial funding and support** through our decentralized funding mechanisms.
4. **Gain visibility, support, and collaboration** across the global ReFi ecosystem

This guide will walk you through each phase of onboarding — from joining the network and submitting a proposal, to launching your node and integrating with peers around the world. Remember, you're not alone in this journey — the ReFi DAO network is here to support you in building a thriving regenerative economy in your bioregion.

Let's get started. 🌱
