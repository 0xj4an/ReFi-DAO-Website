# Starting a ReFi Network Initiative - Onboarding Guide

> 👋
>
> *Welcome, future Network Initiative Leader! By taking the first steps to establish a Network Initiative, you're joining a global movement dedicated to regenerating the Earth through innovative projects and collaborative action. This guide will walk you through the journey of becoming an officially recognized Network Initiative within our network society.*

# Introduction

### 🌿 What is a ReFi DAO Network Initiative?

**Network Initiatives** are **autonomous projects, guilds, or working groups** that align with the mission, vision, values, and identity of ReFi DAO - as described in [[../documents/network-structure|ReFi DAO Network - Structure, Roles, & Governance]].

These initiatives operate independently with their own teams, resources, and structures, while maintaining coherence with the broader network's goals and brand identity. They may also receive financial support and guidance from ReFi DAO Global. 

### 🌟 Example Network Initiatives

- **ReFi Podcast -** A media initiative that shares knowledge, interviews, and insights from the regenerative finance space.
- **ReFi EBF -** Initiative focused on the Ecological Benefits Framework (EBF) and fostering partnerships within the ReFi community.
- **Prosperity Passport Development -** Development of a product to support Web3 identity in the Celo and ReFi economy.

### 🪷 Core Principles & Responsibilities of Network Initiatives

- **Mission Alignment:** Ensure activities and projects remain aligned with ReFi DAO's mission, vision, and values, contributing meaningfully to the overall success and visibility of the network.
- **Collaborative Autonomy:** Operate with a degree of independence, managing resources and operations in a way that reflects the initiative's unique focus, while maintaining open communication with ReFi DAO Global. Initiatives may choose to collaborate closely with ReFi DAO Global on shared goals or strategies when appropriate.
- **Governance Participation:** Primarily engage in ReFi DAO's governance processes when decisions directly impact the initiative's activities. However, initiatives also have the opportunity to provide input on broader strategic decisions and participate in DAO-wide votes if they choose, ensuring their voice is heard in shaping the future of the network.
- **Transparency and Accountability:** Maintain transparency in financial and operational reporting, including sharing periodic updates on progress, impact, and resource utilization with ReFi DAO Global to ensure alignment and mutual accountability across the network.
- **Knowledge Sharing and Contribution:** Share learnings, best practices, and innovations with the broader ReFi DAO community to foster collective growth, collaboration, and continuous improvement within the network.

### 🧭 Your Journey Ahead

This guide will take you through five main phases:

1. **Network Alignment** - Becoming a Network Member by signing the Community Covenant
2. **Contributor Application** - Joining ReFi DAO Global as a Core Contributor
3. **Proposal & Funding** - Securing initial resources through our Gardens funding platform
4. **Activation** - Officially launching your Initiative with full support and recognition
5. **Integration** - Joining the network's coordination channels and ongoing activities
