> ### **Launch a Network Initiative**
>
> **Network Initiatives** are **autonomous projects, guilds, or working groups** that align with the mission, vision, values, and identity of ReFi DAO - as described in [[../documents/network-structure|ReFi DAO Network - Structure, Roles, & Governance]].
>
> These initiatives operate independently with their own teams, resources, and structures, while maintaining coherence with the broader network's goals and brand identity. They may also receive financial support and guidance from ReFi DAO Global. 
>
> **🌟 Example Network Initiatives:**
>
> - **ReFi Podcast -** A media initiative that shares knowledge, interviews, and insights from the regenerative finance space.
> - **ReFi EBF -** Initiative focused on the Ecological Benefits Framework (EBF) and fostering partnerships within the ReFi community.
> - **Prosperity Passport Development -** Development of a product to support Web3 identity in the Celo and ReFi economy.
> - **Process**

>     2. **Develop comprehensive proposal** for your Initiative
>     3. **Submit for funding** through the Network Initiatives Pool
>     4. **Launch and integrate** with network coordination
>
> > 💡 **Note:** The Network Initiatives funding pool is designed to fund **new initiatives or specific partnership initiatives within the ReFi DAO network** (e.g., collaboration projects with a Local Node). This funding is **not intended to support the development of your existing ReFi project** but rather to establish new initiatives that will operate as part of the ReFi DAO ecosystem.
