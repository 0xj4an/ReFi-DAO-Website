# Working Groups

**Working Groups** are a type of **Network Initiative** - multi-disciplinary groups working towards common goals. Working groups bring together diverse expertise to tackle specific challenges and opportunities in regenerative finance.

As Network Initiatives, working groups operate autonomously while maintaining alignment with ReFi DAO's mission, vision, and values. They may receive financial support through the Network Initiatives funding pool.
