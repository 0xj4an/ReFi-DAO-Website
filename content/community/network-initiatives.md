# Network Initiatives

**Network Initiatives** are autonomous projects, guilds, or working groups that align with the mission, vision, values, and identity of ReFi DAO. These initiatives operate independently with their own teams, resources, and structures, while maintaining coherence with the broader network's goals and brand identity. They may also receive financial support and guidance from ReFi DAO Global.

As described in [[../resources-hub/documents/network-structure|ReFi DAO Network - Structure, Roles, & Governance]], Network Initiatives differ from Local Nodes in that they are **thematic or functional** rather than **place-based**. While Local Nodes focus on regional regenerative economies, Network Initiatives bring specialized focus and innovation to specific areas of the DAO's mission.

## Examples of Network Initiatives

### ReFi Podcast
A media initiative that shares knowledge, interviews, and insights from the regenerative finance space.

### Prosperity Passport Development

## Types of Network Initiatives
