# Online Guilds

**Guilds** are a type of **Network Initiative** - connected communities of skilled professionals with shared disciplines. Guilds provide spaces for practitioners to collaborate, share knowledge, and advance their craft within the regenerative finance ecosystem.

As Network Initiatives, guilds operate autonomously while maintaining alignment with ReFi DAO's mission, vision, and values. They may receive financial support through the Network Initiatives funding pool.
