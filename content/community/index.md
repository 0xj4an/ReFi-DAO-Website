# Community

Welcome to the ReFi DAO Community - the home of the regenerative-finance ecosystem and a "network state for people & planet".

ReFi DAO brings together regenerative finance communities, builders, and practitioners from around the world. Whether you're interested in starting a local node, launching a network initiative, or becoming a network member, there's a place for you in our network.

## Local Nodes

Place-based communities experimenting with regenerative finance in their local contexts. Local nodes are autonomous communities that operate within ReFi DAO's framework, adapting regenerative finance tools to their specific regional needs.

[[Local Nodes|local-nodes]] - Explore our global network of local communities

**Key Features:**
- Regional autonomy with global alignment
- Access to funding pools and resources
- Network support and coordination
- Shared tools and best practices

## Network Initiatives

**Network Initiatives** are autonomous projects, guilds, or working groups that align with the mission, vision, values, and identity of ReFi DAO. These initiatives operate independently with their own teams, resources, and structures, while maintaining coherence with the broader network's goals and brand identity.

Unlike Local Nodes which are place-based, Network Initiatives are **thematic or functional** - bringing specialized focus to specific areas like media, research, tooling, or community building.

**Types of Network Initiatives:**
- **Online Guilds** - Communities of skilled professionals (Community Managers, Event Organizers, Content Creators, etc.)
- **Working Groups** - Multi-disciplinary groups tackling specific challenges (WEF Crypto Sustainability Coalition, Regen Renaissance Manifesters, etc.)
- **Media Initiatives** - Like the ReFi Podcast
- **Tooling Projects** - Like Prosperity Passport Development

**Key Features:**
- Thematic focus rather than geographic
- Access to funding pools (up to 3,000 USDGLO)
- Network support and coordination
- Shared tools and best practices
