## About Local Nodes

Local Nodes are regional communities within the ReFi DAO ecosystem that implement place-based regenerative projects. They serve as the on-ground implementation arm of the global regenerative finance movement, connecting global ReFi principles with local environmental and social needs.

Each Local Node operates with regional autonomy while maintaining alignment with ReFi DAO's global vision, mission and values.
